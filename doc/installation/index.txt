Installation
============

Before installing, you will need to choose a machine to be the Bcfg2
server. We recommend a Linux-based machine for this purpose, but the
server will work on any supported operating system. Note that you may
eventually want to run a web server on this machine for reporting and
serving up package repositories. The server package only needs to be
installed on your designated Bcfg2 server machine. The clients package
needs to be installed on any machine you plan to manage by Bcfg2.
